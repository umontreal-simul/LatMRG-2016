The `bin.old` directory contains the executable programs that David obtained by
compiling the last *stable* version of LatMRG that Richard left (now in
`/u/simul/archives/latmrg/stable`.

The `bin.new` directory contains the executable programs that David obtained by
compiling the initial commit of LatMRG in `/u/simul/git/latmrg.git`.

The script `compare.zsh` runs the programs in `bin.old` and in `bin.new` on the
inputs in `inputs` and stores their outputs in `out/old` and `out/new`,
respectively.  A recursive *diff/merge* program, such as
(Meld)[http://meldmerge.org/] can be used to compare the outputs.  This can
serve as high-level regression testing.
